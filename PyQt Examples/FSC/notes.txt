    Speed – Surface Feet per Minute (SFM)
    Feed – Inches per Minute (IPM)
    Feed per Tooth (FPT)
    Adjusted Feed per Tooth – Chip Thinning (AFPT)
    Feed per Revolution (FPR)
    Depth of Cut (DOC)
    Width of Cut (WOC)
    Tool Diameter (D)
    # of Teeth in Cutter (Z)
    Metal Removal Rate – Cubic Inches per Minute (MRR)



Milling Formulas

    Speed (RPM) = (SFM x 3.82) / D
    Feed (IPM) = RPM x FPT x Z
    SFM (Surface Feet per Minute) = (RPM x D) / 3.82
    IPT (Inches per Tooth) = (IPM / RPM) / Z
    MRR (Cubic Inches per Minute) = IPM * WOC * DOC
    AFPT (@ less than 1/2 dia. WOC) = IPM x sqroot of (D / WOC)
    HP (Horsepower Consumption) = MRR x mf
        mf - steel = 1
        mf - gray iron = .65
        mf - aluminum = .3
