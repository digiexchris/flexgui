# Flex GUI
A flexible GUI for LinuxCNC

Flex GUI is a tool to build exactly the GUI you want for LinuxCNC.

* No complicated Qt Designer installs as it uses normal widgets
* No minimum required widgets
* Widget object names are used to connect the code to the widget
* Most Python status items are supported

As of 0.9.0 testing on real machines has begun. 

Note: until the version is 1.0.0 or greater this will often be broken
