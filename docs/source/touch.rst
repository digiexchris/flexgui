Touch Screens
=============

Some entry widgets like MDI and Touch Off have a touch screen popup available to
make it easier to use a Touch Screen.

MDI
---

To enable the G code popup for the MDI entry add a Dynamic Property called
`mode` and set the value to `touch`.

Touch Off
---------

The Coordinate System Touch Off can have either a QDoubleSpinBox or a QLineEdit.
A QLineEdit named `touchoff_le` is used when you have a Touch Screen and you
want the Number Popup when you touch it.
